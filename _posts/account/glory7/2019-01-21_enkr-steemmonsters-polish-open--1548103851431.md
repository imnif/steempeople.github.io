Thanks to @imperfect-one, who organized the event and encouraged me to participate, I woke up an hour earlier than usual and started Monday (it was 6:30am for Korean time) with the Polish Open (Gold League). 27 players checked in and we were good to go!

한글 버전: 간단요약으로 충분할듯. 폴란드 토너 참가했는데, 8강에서 깔끔하게 2스닉이 둘다 미스내면서 떨어졌네요. 이번에 대화하면서 알게 된 것은 폴란드 유저들 중 고수가 많더군요! 물론 외국에서는 한국 유저들 중 고수가 너무 많다고 하겠지만...

First round: my opponent let me go after the first game.

Second round: vs @masterthematrix

We've met many times at various tourneys, and I believe that we both agree that we don't want to face each other in any tourney. "Miss" was lucky for me and I advanced to the next round.

Quarterfinal (3rd round): vs @dreemit

Won the first game with my usual water deck. Everything looked good so far. 

What I underestimated was my opponent's ability to adopt to my deck. The game condition was very similar (lost legendaries, only mana cap changed slightly) and I basically used my previous deck without any thought. My opponent got my deck in a minute and we basically had a mirror matchup:

It was not exactly the same so no rematch, but I lost 50-50 chance.

1-1, and now the final game.

I changed gears and went all-in for 2 sneaks, as without armor they can crush from the back pretty fast. 

But the problem was.. they **"can"**. Not always. "Miss" goddess was not on my side this time. 

I only needed one sneak it to kill the air elemental in round 1 and to win. But...

First Miss!

Second Miss!

And I am out.

Congratulations for winners (@imperfect-one, @cranium, @dreemit, @monstermother) again!
