After the announcement of HF23, there were violence threats against I and my family. I cannot continue my witness position under such threats. 

I have notified my witness team @dev.supporters, and the remaining team members are likely to resign as well.

I would like to thank steem users who supported me. Also, I appreciate kind words from users when I asked for advice after facing such unsuspected threats. (I would not name them here as they may become the targets also.)

Lastly, I don't know (and don't want to know) who you are and how you got this far, but your actions may backfire - you just removed arguably one of the most reasonable witnesses who may discuss or negotiate for your cause.
