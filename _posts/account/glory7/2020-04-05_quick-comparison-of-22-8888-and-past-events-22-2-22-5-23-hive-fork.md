Here's a quick summary/comparison. I tried to exclude my personal judgement to deliver the fundamental "facts" by quoting a lot. 

* Maybe I will share my understanding and opinion at a different post.

---
<br>
### 1. Soft ("temporary", "reversible") or Hard Fork?
<br>

22.2: Soft

22.5: Soft

HIVE: Hard

22.8888: Soft

<br>
---

### 2. Pre-announcement before the actual action was taken?
<br>

22.2: No

22.5: No

HIVE: Yes for the fork date, No for the airdrop exclusion and where the missing airdrops would belong to

22.8888: Yes


<br>
---

###  3. Main argument (from the performers) of the fork
<br>

22.2: "freeze" the "Ninja-mined" stakes that were "promised" to be used in a certain way

22.5: "unfreeze" the legally purchased asset

HIVE: make a decentralized version of STEEM

22.8888: "freeze" accounts that were actively contributed to the potential stoppage of the STEEM blockchain


<br>
---

###  4. Decision criteria regarding stakes
<br>

22.2: based on "promise"(with no legal evidence made public so far) by a previous owner 

22.5: take one's asset back

HIVE: "Accounts excluded who voted a minimum of two sockpuppets or proxied someone who voted a minimum of two and who didn't unvote before the hive announcement with more than 1k sp" (and more)

22.8888: "Accounts that proxied or directly voted to more than 10 witnesses running the version 0.23 on the Steem Blockchain during the Hardfork with an influence higher than two million Steempower." (and more)


<br>
---


###  5. Results (so far)
<br>

22.2: Steem Inc. accounts were "frozen"

22.5: Steem Inc. accounts were "unfrozen" and Steem Inc. installed its own witnesses

HIVE: creation of a "code-copy" chain that are identical to the STEEM blockchain, except that confiscating 326 individual accounts' "asset" and Steem Inc. related accounts' "asset" to the steem.dao account (allegedly, there could be a system where these accounts may get these "assets" back, but so far no date/plan/detail announced)

22.8888: temporal restriction of 8 accounts (but thanks to the pre-announcement, most accounts (except about 3) have taken actions before the actual fork so restriction is basically limited to 2-3 accounts)

Hope this helps.
