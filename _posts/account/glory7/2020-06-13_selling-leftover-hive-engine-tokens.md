After being "blacklisted", I didn't really have much interest in participating HIVE and former steem engine tribes that decided to migrate. 

* I mean, most of my followers/people I follow are still here at STEEM, and I get downvoted heavily over there so why would I move. 

Quick advice for Steemians like me...

1. Even if you don't plan to participate in HIVE, make sure to check your hive-engine token balances. It may be worth something.

2. I find that using DEC market is the easiest and most cost-effective way to move HIVEp to STEEM (or STEEMp).

A while ago, I was notified that there would be some hive-engine tokens if I had matching steem-engine tokens. I looked them up, and it seems that I got bunch - in particular, LEO and PAL tokens were worth some money. 

So I started unstaking them, and forgot about it. 

And today, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I got about $200 worth tokens to sell (mostly LEO).

* I still don't know how this BEE and WORKERBEE things work - my understanding is that they are mirrors or ENG and EM(EMFOUR). I guess that I got WORKERBEE staked as I staked EM long time ago and they "airdropped" WORKERBEE, as I myself did not do anything. 

---

Fortunately, the price of LEO token has gone up significantly since my unstaking. It was below 0.05 then.. and now it's over 0.2. Cannot complain, right?

After selling LEO and PAL, I had about 740 HIVEp. Great!

* I could have placed sell order to get a bit more, but I didn't want to waste time so I just sold them at the bid price. Good thing is that both markets were liquid enough so that I could sell mine without moving prices.

I got some HIVEp. Now what?

As I need to convert HIVEp to STEEM (or STEEMP), I looked for some options. It seems that DEC was the best choice of transfer medium.

1. DEC is listed in both steem-engine and hive-engine,

2. Bid-ask spread is very small,

3. Liquidity is great.

* I assume that 2 and 3 are thanks to the Splinterlands team bots.

Let's take a look. First, HIVE engine. 

DEC price is pretty stable, and bid-ask spread is like 0.00001. Effective spread is also like 0.00002, which is basically zero. 

I could convert my HIVEp to about 240K DEC.

Now let's go to the STEEM engine. 

Again, liquidity is great and I could trade with minimal slippage cost.

Good thing about using this method is that you don't need to pay conversion in-and-out fee of 1% when you use steem or hive engines.

<br>

I easily transferred my DEC from hive engine at no cost, and I may easily transfer DEC to steem engine at no cost too.

So should I desire, I can send DEC to steem-engine and sell DEC for STEEMp whenever I want. Cool.

I noticed that they have "SWAP.STEEM" token too, but I didn't bother studying this. Also, bid-ask spread seems to be a bit wider too.

* Would appreciate if someone let me know how this works and whether it is more effective to "swap" between HIVE and STEEM.
