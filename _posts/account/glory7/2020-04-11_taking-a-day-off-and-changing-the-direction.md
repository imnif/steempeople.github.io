I have spent too much time - compared to what I used to, and compared to what I have as "free" time - on Steem/Hive issue for a couple of weeks. 

I was supposed to write about the SF 22.8888 - and when I got up this morning, I was like, what's the point of that would be. 

Most people already have their mind preoccupied with whatever ideology or belief they originally had for whatever reasons, and my writing some articles would not change their minds and maybe only make situations worse.

* For users who still ask "what is the reason of SF 22.8888?", I would recommend reading the official announcement [Steem Consensus Witness Statement : Softfork 0.22.8888](https://steemit.com/witness-category/@softfork22888/steem-consensus-witness-statement-softfork-0-22-8888). One may agree or disagree, but at least let's start from the same page.

I was too tired, so at least for today I wanted to just enjoy Steem like what I did before 22.2. - play some Steem based games like Splinterlands and Nextcolony, and read some articles and post replies. 

And I happen to read [[Discussion Post] Where do we take STEEM from here? A post for STEEM community discussion](https://steemit.com/steem/@cmp2020/discussion-post-where-do-we-take-steem-from-here-a-post-for-steem-community-discussion) and some of great replies, including @jaki01 and @whatsup 's.

and I realized that what I have been doing recently would not necessary help STEEM - I should focus on how to make STEEM great (again?). 

---

I believe that at this point, it is practically impossible to negotiate and reach some kind of "agreement". I tried to talk to lots of people - and I am pretty sure others did too - but I am not aware of any significant progress. 

It seems that this situation is close to "divorce" - and each side we should focus on living life of her own. 

Instead of arguing what the other side has done wrong, I (and probably we) should try to find ways to split up asap.
