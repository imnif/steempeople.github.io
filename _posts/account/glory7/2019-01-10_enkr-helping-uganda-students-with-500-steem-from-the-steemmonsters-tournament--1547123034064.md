After winning the first major Steemmonsters Tournament, I wrote an article - [Every Game Revealed - Winning the Bernie Sanders New Years Invitational](https://steemit.com/steemmonsters/@glory7/everygame-revealed-winning-the-bernie-sanders-new-years-invitational-1546348769154) - and mentioned that I planned to donate/sponsor my winning(500 STEEM, as you see).

Since there are already lots of Steemmonsters tournaments available, I was more inclined to "donate". The remaining issue was where and how. 

And I found that @yohan2on contacted @ukk, asking for help to support students in Uganda. Following @ukk 's lead, the Korean Steemit community raised funds to help students before - here is what @yohan2on recently sent to @ukk, according to this [posting](https://steemit.com/kr/@ukk/4x1hkj). I quoted his request below:

>Yes I have some idea. I am volunteering in Kenya helping street kids. I am going to be feeding them on Saturday. I am helping them to participate in a soccer project that is on the steem blockchain to help them learn the game and also buy them some football kits.

>These street kids need food and also school fees. They have very torching stories. I know you love Uganda and have helped many Ugandans last year. Can you do something for these Kenyan street kids.

>Those 25 children in Uganda will also need your support again this year because the four months for the other school fees paid last year got done. Will you continue supporting them this year?

>@ukk I have so many ideas. I have shared those ones for the time being. I will be sharing more. Whats your opinion about them.

So it's been 4 months since we supported them, and I guess students need another fundraising. The Korean community already raised more than 300 STEEM in two days, and I read the article and decided to join with my Bernie Sanders Invitational winning to make it 800 STEEM (as of now, it may go up!). 

I hope it will be spent well!

얼마 전 새해 기념 스몬 대회(@berniesanders 후원)에서 우승한 후, 상금의 대부분을 후원에 쓸 것이라고 [후기](https://steemit.com/steemmonsters/@glory7/--1546290435078)에 썼었습니다. 

그런데 생각보다 스몬 대회들의 후원이 많고 대회도 많아서, 스몬 대회에 후원하기보다는 다른 곳을 찾아보던 중, @ukk님의 [글](역시 KR 커뮤니티) 을 읽고 우간다와 케냐 학생들을 후원하는 데에 지원하기로 결정하였습니다.

![500스팀 기증.jpg](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/dclick/image/glory7/1547122826393)

요즘 시세로는 500스팀이 그렇게 큰 돈은 아니지만, 그곳 학생들에게는 물가를 고려하면 도움이 될 만한 수준의 학비와 생활비가 되겠지요. 

제 지원 전에도 이미 300스팀 넘게 모였다고 하는데, 역시 KR 커뮤니티는 따뜻한가 봅니다.
