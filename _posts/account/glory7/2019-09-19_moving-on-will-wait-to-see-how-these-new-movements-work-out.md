This posting summarizes what I have learned from the previous posting  "[Do you think Palnet "holds no value" and disagree with minnowsupport bot?](https://steemit.com/sct/@glory7/do-you-think-palnet-holds-no-value-and-disagree-with-minnowsupport-bot)  " and what I am going to do due to the conversation we had on that posting.

#### Primary reason of writing the previous post: the value of SCT
<br>

When I wrote the previous article, I wanted to discuss how one may think that SCT has no real value, as I believe that SCT (or steemcoinpan) was one of the most successful steem engine tribes so far in terms of trading volume, price, tag ranking (currently 2nd), number of active users, etc.

#### It seems that I was not aware of the more important issue
<br>

But it seems that lots of readers found different topic a lot more interesting, which is **downvoting regarding buying/selling votes.** And if I add one more, about **whether a post is going to the trending section.** It seems that buying/selling votes was a big, hot topic and the trending section was a big deal too. So I've been missing lots of "important" trends. 

As I have stated before, I have never used non-steem engine bid bots before so I don't know much about issues regarding "traditional" bid bots. And I have seldom looked at the trending section (basically unless I misclick or someone specifically asks to read one) and only read my feed, I did not know (And hence did not care) that whether my posts (or others' posts) were on steemit trending section.

#### Wide Spectrum: Opinions
<br>

Going through replies and messages (including discord ones), I have learned a lot.

While it is impossible to reach consensus, I believe that most people would okay with the following summary:

#### Buying votes that makes "lower quality" postings to the trending section is bad.
<br>

and of course there are wide range of opinions. 

some people think that any vote buying/selling should be downvoted.

some think that "small amount" vote buying is fine.

some think that vote sellers should be contacted/dealt with first. 

some think that it is up to users' decision.

some think that downvote is bad.

some think that downvote is necessary evil.

some think that downvote is great. 

I may go on and on, but I guess you are already tired of reading it.

#### Moving on: Let's see how these new movements work out
<br>


I still believe that there is a better way to downvote and/or communicate. However, now I understand where these downvote arguments are coming from.

While I am pretty much neutral to buying/selling votes, I felt that I would prefer to not get involved in unnecessary arguments regarding vote buying or downvoting. 

And I also agree that there should be some changes, given continuously decreasing active users and steem prices. Why not wait to see how these new "movements" would end up?

So I decided to 

1. Not use steem-engine bots, in particular SCT and steemmonsters

2. Undelegate my SP from SCT and Steemmonsters, as my undelegating would reduce the SP of the bot (while small) and it will actually help the users from these bots by reducing chance of hitting trending.

#### Wide Spectrum: Attitude and Behavior
<br>

People may have different thoughts. In fact, they do have different opinions. The more important aspect is how one communicates. 

Attitude toward the posting and how people presented their feelings/opinions were diverse too. 

Some are considerate and kind, while some are rude and low-level.

Some are adamant and stubborn, while some are open. 

Some are informative and contributed knowledge and thoughts, while some are close to ignorant. 

Some actually practice what they preach, which some are close to hypocrites (I thank @blanchy for pointing this out)

#### Wrapping up...
<br>

I am not sure whether I would continue writing articles in English, as I will continue to focus on the Korean community (and steemmonsters, of course) and SCT(steemcoinpan). 

But I would like to express my gratitude for many steemians who shared their thoughts and enhanced my understanding. Just to name a few:

@whatsup: thank you for writing the reason for downvote, as I might not have learned why that happened. And of course for the following constructive discussion.

@tarazkp and @jayplayco: I appreciate your detailed informative conversation.

@ericet, @leeyh2, @jaydih, @philippekiene, @mermaidvampire, @chekohler, @kharma.scribbles, @lordbutterfly, @trafalgar, @aggroed, @yabapmatt: for sharing your thoughts via various ways. 

@fenrir78, @ukk, @realmankwon, @happyberrysboy, @zzings, @donekim, @lovelyyeon.sct: for providing supports with "Thumbs up" function which directly gives the author SCT, 

and @blanchy for providing super useful informative advice.
