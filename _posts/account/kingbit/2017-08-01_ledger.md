![IMG_9757.JPG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmV51chPocBjbHAaSk6BsfvJSV9Nf3Xkq31ADEj8BWbz4h/IMG_9757.JPG) Ledger의 Nano S 를 가지고 있습니다. 그래서 관심있는 기사라서 공유합니다. 


기사의 핵심
Before the fork : updating your Ledger devices
Again, you only need to do this if you want to transact on the Bitcoin Cash chain right now.
Nano S/Blue, Nano and HW.1 owners : update the “Ledger Bitcoin Wallet” chrome application to the 1.8.0 version (restarting Chrome should be enough)
Nano S/Blue owners : you’ll need to install the “Bitcoin Cash” application from Ledger Manager and use it to transact on the Bitcoin Cash chain. This requires the latest firmware for the Nano S (1.3.1) — you can follow this guide to update if necessary (in case you have to update the firmware from a firmware version below 1.3.0, you must have your mnemonic phrase available)
Nano and HW.1 owners : you’ll need to install the 1.0.2 firmware update bundled with the updated “Ledger Bitcoin Wallet” chrome application (you must have your mnemonic phrase available)
Unplugged owners or if you don’t want to update your device : you will still get your Bitcoin Cash balance. If you wish to transact immediately, you should import individual private keys into a compatible wallet following the “Advanced” part of this recovery procedure — be aware that there’ll likely be scammers advertising fake splitting tools and dedicated “Bitcoin Cash” wallets, and do your own research, slowly.
