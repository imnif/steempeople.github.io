Hi Guys!
 We celebrate the start of the weedcash.
You have heard that we only allow postings related to weed.
So I will post a story about Korean law.
You have to be careful if you come to Korea.
In Korea, weed is illegal.
In Korea, there is no forgiveness for drugs.
Of course, if you are a celebrity or have a lot of money, you might be able to avoid it. Perhaps...

I used Google Translate. This is part of the weed laws.
Article 1 (Purpose) The purpose of this law is to contribute to the improvement of public health by appropriately managing the hemp and preventing its leakage.
 
Article 2 (Definitions of Terminology) (1) In this Act, "hemp" refers to any product made from cannabis (cannabis sativael) and its resin and cannabis or its resin as raw materials. However, the stem and root of cannabis and the stem of mature cannabis are excluded.
 
(2) The term "hemp handler" in this Act means a person who falls under any of the following subparagraphs and who has obtained permission under Article 5.
 
1. Hemp Grower: A person who grows cannabis for the purpose of harvesting fibers or seeds.
 
2. Hemp researchers: Those who grow cannabis or import hemp and use hemp for research purposes.
 
 
Article 4 (Prohibition of Act) No one shall act in any of the following subparagraphs. Provided, however, that this shall not apply to cases where the hemp researcher performs the activities prescribed in No. 1 or No. 2 with the permission of the Minister of Health, Social Affairs and Social Affairs.
 
1. Importing or exporting hemp
 
2. Manufacture hemp (except for cannabis)

5. Providing to others the place for doing the acts of No. 1 through No. 4 while knowing the definition.
