<center>**I am Love Echo, on a mission to help people eat healthy and live a healthy lifestyle. ðŸ’—**</center>

Doing household chores all day long is very energy consuming. But havenâ€™t you heard that labor work doesnâ€™t really give any exercising effect? Do you really need to go to the gym to work out and lose that unwanted extra pounds although you had already moved and sweated so much doing your household chores?

Even if you have been eating healthy with a strict healthy diet whether to lose weight or to stay healthy, you may sometimes eat food that are far from staying lean and healthy, because you may eat out with your friends or families or maybe simply just because you couldnâ€™t control your appetite. We often feel very guilty when this happens. Since I spend a lot of time researching how to eat healthy and live a healthy life, honestly, I often get really guilty and even feel sick after eating deep-fried food or desserts covered with sugar.

However, as weâ€™ve heard so many times in our lives, everything depends on the mind. Our bodies are so amazing that it react to how we think. So letâ€™s check out the reason why we should change our thoughts and minds to stay healthy and also to stay young and beautiful.
