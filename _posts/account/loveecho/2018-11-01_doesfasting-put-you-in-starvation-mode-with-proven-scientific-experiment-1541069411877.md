### Is it really ok to fast?
<br>
What do you hear the most from people around you when you first start intermittent fasting?
‚ÄúNever starve yourself to lose weight!‚Äù
‚ÄúIf you starve yourself, you will slow down your metabolism and gain more weight in the end.‚Äù
‚ÄúJust eat less and don‚Äôt eat more than 1,000 kcal per day!‚Äù
<br>
What they are saying is that our body turns into the ‚ÄúStarvation Mode‚Äù if we fast or skip our meals. ‚ÄúStarvation Mode‚Äù refers to shutting or slowing down the metabolism and preventing the body from burning fat. So if you get into this mode, you tend to gain more weight once you start eating. But do you think this kind of logic is backed by science? Has it really been proven by scientific experiments? Or is it just a myth?
<br>
Let‚Äôs check in this video if skipping your meals in the form of intermittent fasting will really put your body in ‚ÄúStarvation Mode.‚Äù
