I've been looking for a lav mic to carry around with me  for vlog videos. Recently I made a video on shopping at IKEA and the sound was horrible as I just filmed and recorded with my cell phone. So I finally decided to purchase a lav mic and I found out that most lav mics are around $200~500!!

I didn't want to purchase such an expensive one as it would be my first lav mic and I wanted to first find a budget mic to try and go for a better one later. 

Spending almost a whole day searching for a budget lav mic, I eventually ended up getting this BOYA BY-M1 as it had great reviews from many Youtubers. Not only it's almost the cheapest one out there, but the sound quality is also pretty good.

You can connect it directly to your camera or your phone(PC). I am going to use the voice recording tool on my phone to record my voice and use a separate camera or a phone to film the video.

It's really simple and small so you can just carry it around in a little pocket. If you are thinking of creating videos on Youtube or Dtube,  I definitely recommend this lav mic. Of course there may be greater lav mics out there, however I truly think that this is the best budget mic for beginners.
