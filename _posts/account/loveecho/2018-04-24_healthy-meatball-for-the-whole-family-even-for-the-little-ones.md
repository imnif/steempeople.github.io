#### Hello! I am @loveecho with a passion to help people eat healthy and live a healthy lifestyle!ðŸ’—
<br/>
My little one seems to not enjoy his porridge-like baby food recently. HE WANTS TO CHEW!ðŸ˜¹
So I was a bit concerned and thought about what I should make for him. Meatball came up to my mind with grassfed ground beef which I purchased recently for baby food!

#### Itâ€™s too simple to call it a recipe, so I will just jot down few words about it.

>You can just make them by mixing up gound beef, grass-fed preferably, all kinds of chopped vegetables, a pinch of oregano (you can definitely skip this if you wish), and 1 egg. After mixing them all together, you can make them in a little round shape. *Please note that if you wish to add onions, you MUST stir-fry them a bit in order to avoid the meatballs to be too watery and wet.*
<br/>
Since I made a lot a once, I divided them into one servings and put them in the freezer. Since I am worried about them sticking together, I lightly coated them with coconut flour.
<br/>
*The whole family can definitely all enjoy this healthy meatball since the ingredients in the meatball are only grassfed beef, vegetables, eggs, salt, and coconut flour!

You can also put them in your spaghetti sauce to make meatball spaghetti!

The air is so fresh here in Korea after heavy rain yesterday!
Have a wonderful day!
