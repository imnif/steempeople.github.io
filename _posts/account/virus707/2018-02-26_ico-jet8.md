아직 KYC 등록을 받고 있네요.

시작시간까지 남은 시간은 36시간정도입니다.

맥시멈 10이더 최소 0.1이더입니다.

무슨코인이냐고요?

.....

스팀에서 인기좋은 애픽스와 거의 같은 컨셉의 코인입니다.

블록체인의 인스타그램을 표방하고 있습니다.

현재 반응도 좋아서 텔레그램에서도 7만명이상이 있습니다.

성공가능성을 볼때 미지수지만

펌핑가능성은 있어보입니다.

중국인들은 ICO 참여가 불가능하다는게 흥미롭습니다.

더 자세한 정보는 관심이 있다면 직접 찾아보시길 권합니다

ICO drop에서는 평가가 medium이고 risk는 high로 나오네요

# 두둥 ICO 정보 작성중에  사실 더 긴급뉴스가 떠서 옮겨봅니다.

아마 이미 아시는 분들은  다들 아시겠지만

Dear Poloniex community,


We're proud to announce that Poloniex will be joining the Circle team as of today, February 26. As we have collaborated closely with Circle on this union, we have come to a deep mutual respect and strong alignment in our vision for the future of the global crypto ecosystem. Circle is thrilled to welcome Poloniex and our users into their growing global business and to work together to accelerate the evolution of the token economy.


What can you expect?

In the near term, platform updates will be behind-the-scenes and focused on improving the existing user experience instead of radically altering the product. We expect no disruptions in service nor in the availability of your funds. Circle and Poloniex have committed to preserving the features and functionality that have helped our platform grow to where we are today.


The Circle team will immediately begin working alongside us to expand customer support and technical operations to further scale our product. We know that our incredible growth over the past few years has not come without some growing pains for our users. Though we realize that no user experience can be perfect across the board, we hate disappointing you and recommit today to relentlessly pursue nothing short of excellence in our product.


We look forward to building on our foundations with the Circle team to grow our reach globally and to continue to provide access to groundbreaking projects in the cryptocurrency space. Please take a look at our press release and this blogpost from the Circle team for more thoughts on why we're excited to join forces in the months ahead.


Thank you for your support!

When we founded Poloniex in 2014, we had high hopes for the future of cryptocurrency but never could have imagined how quickly this space would expand and evolve. We'd like to thank each and every one of our users for joining us on this adventure thus far. Your early faith in the community and passion for the underlying technology has inspired us and fueled us forward on a daily basis. We couldn't have built this without you, and we look forward to continuing on this journey together in the years to come.


Onward and upward,


The Poloniex team
