That's war!

Drug War is a War game

What you need to do to make the war vigorous

# 1
Make war points or war coins.
The war serves as a kind of (steem) miner.
it allows wars to happen more for other purposes. (incentives!)
A war coin is awarded to the warlord top10 every day(or every week)

# 2
Must make an item market
It is linked with No. 1.
It can only be purchased as a war point.

# 3
Safe amount should be reduced. 
Otherwise, all will only invest in warehouse upgrades.
Limit the number of times you can heist.
If you purchase a specific item, you must make additional heist possible.

# 4
Need to dramatically improve find's search system
(Current resource situation or military situation should also be indicated in search condition.)

# 5
It must have a guild system or declaration war function.
Group system(gangs ) should be created.
Group vs group war should be possible.

At the World War level, war outbreaks should occur several times a month.

# 6
It should be able to damage buildings as well as damage the troops during the war
