What a match~!
I love this monster due to the protecting spell.
I usually expect nothing beside protecting and little curing.
However this time.. he contributed beyond my expectation by being even an attacker striking the most meaningful attack with the support of Selenia!
I am considering to level him up to 10, the last one which gives him 2 range attack.
what about you? Do you think it is worth collecting more than 300 cards from Lv.8 which costs almost 45 USD (1 card=0.15 USD)
