These are three basic historical facts which you should know before travel to Korea.

1. Current capital of South Korea is 'Seoul' which was also a capital of 'Joseon dynasty'.
2. Joseon is the most recent kingdom ruling Korea peninsula for 500 years (1392~1897).
3. Japanese invasion occured on 1592 and destroyed almost everything including the royal cultural heritages as well. It is also a point we split the Joseon history into two parts, the former and the latter Joseon.

I believe the more we understand Joseon society, the better we could understand current Korean society. (Remember Korea as a nation was not founded through resisitng Joseon dynasty unlike France in 1789.)
