Hi? Stemeans,

My name is  @parisfoodhunter.


Today I went to the Paris 14th district bakery ** 2M** which received the first prize of baguette bread in Paris in 2018.

Now let's go to the best bakery in Paris.

At the entrance to the bakery, the glass door says, "First prize at the best baguette in Paris in 2018".

It is a representative bread list of this bakery.
Cereal bread, walnut bread, sesame bread, and so on.

The name of the bakery is 2M, and it is said that the name of the craftsman baker and 2M of the front of the castle Mahmoud M'seddi.
My parents were Tunisian immigrants (father and baker) and Mahmoud was born in Paris and was a 27 year old baker.

I worked for 8 years in my father 's bakery and originally the chef was a Patisserie major, and I could not find a delicious bakery in the neighborhood, so I went into the baker' s way of making myself.

After finishing seventh in the final finals of the best baguette competition in Paris in 2017, we have built up ourselves after a tremendous effort and eventually receive the best baguette award in Paris.
