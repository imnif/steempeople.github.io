## End of Referral Rewards System

- We have decided to end SCTR-based referral rewards system. 
- End date: from Dec 23, 2019(KST)
- How to settle for undistributed balance in @sct.ref account.
(1) Each 50% of the balance will be distributed to R token holders and SCTR token holders by holding ratio.
(2) The undistributed balance shall be determined based on  Dec 23, 2019(KST).
(3) How to apply for SCT swap: Sending R Token(s) or SCTR Token(s) to @sctr account.
 
- SCT Swap Schedule:  from today to December 31, 2019 (before 00:00 AM (KST) January 1, 2020). 
- SCT Distribution Date: January 1, 2020 at a specific time
- Remaining balance of SCT after SCT swap period will be burned out.
- After December 31, 2019, R Token and SCTR Token will be delisted from steem engine DEX.


## New Management Policy for Referral Fund

- Currently, 5% of daily SCT issued are allocated for SCTR token-based referral programs. 
- We have not yet decided how to use this referral fund . 
- Potential use cases discussed in the meeting:
(1) 2.5%: Basic Up-voting (staking 2.5% of daily SCT issued into @sct.down to support basic up-voting policy. up-voting condition will be changed to 200 SCT staking holders from 0.1% SCT holders
(2) 2.5%: Recommended Authors.

## curation reward multiplier changes(1.3 to 1.0)

- We will change the curation reward multiplier from 1.3 to 1.0.
- If the reward multiplier changes to 1.0, the voting power will be directly proportional to the SCT staking amount, and the posting compensation for users who have staked a small amount of SCT will be increased compared to the previous 1.3 multiplier policy.
- Changing Date : January 1, 2020 (scheduled) 
- We are open to any kinds of comments about this multiplier change.

## End of Curator Program 
- The curator system will end on December 31, 2019.
- It has not yet decided how to use approximately 120,000 SCT staking resources related to curating program

## SCT Alliance
- No progress has been made for building up SCT Alliance that was planned for configuration at the end of 2019. 
- The current management team will continue to operate SCT community. And we will open discussions to build up SCT alliance in 2020.
