This is a community for introducing yourselves and get to know each other. Please feel free to introduce yourself and start the great journey of STEEM(it).

Well, then I guess I'll start shortly with my own.

I joined steemit back in 2018 February right when the bear had just caught up. Obviously, I have a lot of wounds left by the bears. Those claws were more than deep enough to leave some serious damages in my balance sheet, but I also had great moments in my life across 2018~2019 to reach equilibrium. 

In 2018, I've got married to my beloved wife. <sub>(I remember powering up steem on my wedding day. lol)</sub>
In 2019, my wife and I became parents to our first son. <sub>(I remember powering up steem on his 0 birthday.)</sub>

So, yeah. Life didn't turn out too bad, huh? And, did you realize how much I think about steem there? I believe steem is the one of the most under valued blockchain in the whole world today. This blockchain with SMTs and Communities feature from upcoming upgrade has sooooo much potential. Plus, it is one of the very few blockchains out there that lets you earn crypto through human labor(simple posting) which I consider a huge deal. Others require expensive mining equipments, require investment of your fiat initially to earn more crypto(pure POS ones), wallet addresses like "awewoiauefh34i9ifheaw0f0iwiha0300iiwef****" nonsense or "12 letter fix", blah blah etc, etc.. ðŸ˜‚Anyway, I have too much to talk about if I really start the comparison between Steem and other blockchain. I must say Steem blockchain has the greatest potential to get adopted by the mass. You'll be amazed as you study deeply along steem.

Now, we're headed to almost 2020 and I'm looking forward to seeing great stuffs. In terms of Crypto market, I don't know when it'll turn around from this bear market but I do believe 2020 is a strong suspect. Other than that I really miss myself missing the recent SteemFest4 in Bangkok. Although I've watched the entire recordings, I wish to join the next round. 

All right guys, I guess this is it. Maybe I didn't get to talk about myself that much after all but the stage has always been yours to talk about... ;) By the way, I'm Korean; I speak native Korean but I spent my teenage in California so I speak pretty good English. Then, I spent a half decade in Italy so that makes me understand a little bit of Italian, too. ;)

Okay, see you guys around then. Peace!
