>"I will be glad to be the winner of the delegation because I need it to support people who join steemit through me and other steemians whose quality posts are not rewarded with quality payout." by @oluwashinaayomi

I liked @oluwashinaayomi's comment that he left to apply to this giveaway a week ago. Also, I found the account active enough to be able to keep his word. Believe me it's always hard for me to pick one person out of many applicants, but I do want to keep my [purpose](https://steemit.com/steemit/@jaydih/free-steem-power-delegation-relay-100sp-for-4-weeks-long) straight. "One person every week, continuously."
<sub>`Please don't forget to apply again and again until it gets your turn!! I mean serious.`</sub>

Now, let's expect @oluwashinaayomi to bring more positive energy to Steemit! **Also, for those of you who want to become the next week's winner please leave a comment below.**

AND, Thank you to those who are willing support or already supporting this giveaway project!
