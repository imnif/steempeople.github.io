>"Because i just want to increase my SP and then i want to help new comers who are writing good content and they are not able to come ahead. So i will make them help."
By @kmayegaindia

I've noticed that he's been very active on Steemit especially during the days like now where people have almost forgotten the interest of crypto as well as Steemit. I believe he can make some difference during the wait to the next big wave ought to come!!
Believe me it's always hard for me to pick one person out of many applicants, but I do want to keep my [purpose](https://steemit.com/steemit/@jaydih/free-steem-power-delegation-relay-100sp-for-4-weeks-long) straight. "One person every week, continuously."
<sub>`Please don't forget to apply again and again until it gets your turn!! I mean serious.`</sub>

Now, let's expect @kmayegaindia to bring more positive energy to Steemit! **Also, for those of you who want to become the next week's winner please leave a comment below.**

AND, Thank you to those who are willing support or already supporting this giveaway project!
