 Today is my 100th day of joining Steemit! Interestingly, I have 100 followers exactly as of today.  <strong>What a coincidence!</strong>

 I must say that I’ve never been a fan of any social media such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram but here I am on Steemit continuously checking in for 100 days and even now I’m working on this post!
>I guess, <strong>“There is something about Steemit.”</strong></br>

 I do find it hard to write out my thoughts whether it’s an informative or an essay especially on a public blog, not that I’m shy or anything I just don’t feel secured, so when I look at people writing great posts I admire their work. 
>Maybe I’ll need my practice more often on Steemit to feel more natural. I hope to improve in the upcoming days and be able to give myself a big smile on 200th day!</br>

 I want to emphasize one thing that people like me also want to get along with Steemit spending efforts to try writing tells me a lot. I definitely believe there’s far more to expect in growth potential to this platform in the upcoming future. 
This does have something that draws people’s attention in a positive addictive way.
>Stay tuned and we shall find out.</br>

Well, I guess this is it for today. I just wanted to celebrate myself of 100 followers on 100th day of joining. Thank you for following and thanks for reading.
Catch you guys later. See ya.
