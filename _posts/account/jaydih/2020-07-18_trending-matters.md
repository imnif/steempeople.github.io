Dear @Steemit & @steemitblog,

After years of trial from the launch of Steemit isn’t it obvious now that payout based upvote should play significantly less role in trending?

<b>What is good to read doesn’t necessarily match whom I want to give money out.</b>(through the mean of upvotes)

Payout should be acting as a secondary component that traces the trending not vice versa as how it acts as a lead now. Current method on trending is significantly influenced by bigger sized upvotes which often do not make sense.

Can we re-design the trending so that it is significantly less influenced by upvotes?

Because “Trending” really matters. 

Thanks.
