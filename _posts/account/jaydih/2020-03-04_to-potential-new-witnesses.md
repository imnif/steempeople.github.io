There's been too many dramas on-going here but I still believe our community has the power to overcome the current situation and fix it and make it even better. Let me cut the shit and get straight to the point.

I'm seeking for new potential witness(es) out there in our community that are rightful to carry on this blockchain. I would like to find someone new with entirely from outside of current interest that has to do with neither of previous witnesses, Justin's stake, nor ninja mined stake. I want someone who can add value to our blockchain apart from these matters.

Please do your campaign and reach out.
