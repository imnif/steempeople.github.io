Hello Steemians!

I'm going to hold a free SP delegation relay for some time and here's how it's going to work.

I will be using my 500~600 SP to continuously delegating 100 SP per week to one person at a week for 4 weeks long delegation for free! `"YES, for FREE."` After four weeks, I will cancel the delegation and search for another candidate for the next free delegation through another posting.

Considering that 7 days is required to get my delegated SP back after canceling the delegation, 500 SP will be sufficient to have a weekly four weeks long 100 SP free delegation relay. But I will keep additional +100 SP just in case I forget to cancel the delegation in time for another new free delegation.

I know it's only a little for now, but I still want to help the ecosystem of Steemit to grow and really hope this to expand a lot further as I'm passionate about this new disruptive platform of blockchain technology. And who knows, if I get more steem later on I might even be more willing to help for more. Or vice versa if my situation get worse over time. LOL &#128514;&#128514;

So guys, here's how I'm going to choose the winner each week.

>Please,

Basically, I'm dedicating my 1000~1200 Steem power in total to hold this free weekly 100SP delegation relay! `500~600SP for English users and another 500~600SP for Korean users`
Please understand It's not so little for me! &#128514;&#128514;

See you guys then! And, I really hope to find some good candidates each week!!&#128077;
