>The profile introduction of @nilesackerman : "My purpose here on planet earth is to serve the environment and its beautiful people by contributing to greater harmony in our world"

I liked @nilesackerman's quote which is written on the profile, and that made my pick. Since it's a first round I wanted to choose everyone who applied, but to keep my [purpose](https://steemit.com/steemit/@jaydih/free-steem-power-delegation-relay-100sp-for-4-weeks-long) straight, "One person every week, continuously", I had to choose one. Believe me it wasn't so easy.
<sub>`Why don't you consider applying again and again until it gets your turn!! I mean serious.`</sub>

Let's now expect @nilesackerman will bring in more energy to Steemit! **Also, for those of you who want to become the next week's winner please leave a comment below.**

AND, Thank you to those who are willing support or already supporting this giveaway project!
<h3><center>「<div class="phishy">Pleasse, RESTEEM</div>」 and Upvote to widely spread out this project.

<sub>`As the `[purpose](https://steemit.com/steemit/@jaydih/free-steem-power-delegation-relay-100sp-for-4-weeks-long)` of this project is to help the ecosystem of Steemit, I expect to delegate to someone who is more willing to be active during the 4 weeks delegation period.`</sub>
