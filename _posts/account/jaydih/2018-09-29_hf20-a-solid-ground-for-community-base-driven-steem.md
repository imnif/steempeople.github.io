I was wondering about the price of the RC, which was introduced with the HF20 and it was ridiculously high. Was this price made inadvertently?

Now, if you want to use the SteemIt without RC restriction, you have to have more than 100 sp, which is $100 as of now or more than $1000 if the price of steem goes up to $10.

But now that the hard fork 20 was described to be as "successful" as it was intended to be, the current RC price has been set properly, no doubt. (At least from the developers' perspective)
<b>If so, What is it that they see from the future blue print so that they painfully went ahead with this patch?</b>

SMT is expected to go up next March. <b>`So what's the relationship between RC and SMT?..`</b>

And then Eureka! The puzzle was instant.


<b>Here are my thoughts on how things will go in the future with HF20.</b>


- Individuals are less likely to write through their own accounts (because of the high cost of purchasing steem to secure RCs)
- An account that becomes a specific community collects SteemPower (buy or lease SP to secure a lot of RC resources)
- The community account grants Posting authorization to sp leasers or community participants' account via dapp (like partiko, steepshot, appics, etcs)
- Each individual will be given the right to post from a specific community (account). This will allow users to use the rich RC resources of the community account.  When they write/post through a dapp, it leaves a "watermark" of the writer's personal account at the end of the post. (Similar to how Steepshot, Appics, or Partiko leave watermarks)
- Every Steem, SP, or SBD earned from those postings will be first collected to the community account. (because the account where the postings are being generated is a community account)(so the community will collect more RC in this way)
- Since each author already has a watermark of the author account in each of the posting, writers can be paid by SMT of the community's in correspondence to the steem, sp, SBD earnings that they had generated to the community(account) through each of their postings
- Individual users are rewarded by SMT and then redeem that SMT through community or trade through transfer transactions or community exchanges
- Each community can also use their SMT as steem's RC to allocate community account usage(RC) to participants

Eureka! In the end, many communities will be built on Steem blockchain as a mean of earning Steem, SP, and SBDs.

> These innumerable SMTs will endeavor to secure RCs to expand their communities, which in turn will lead to massive steem demand.
(At least, I hope)

Did they really see this "big blue print" so that they went ahead with the HF20 patch? Did they really see this gigantic demand coming from all this which will push up the price of steem to moon?

After SMT put in place, I expect "Steem Market Place" will be the next. Once enough people are gathered or engaged through many different communities through each of their dapp, there will be a market place where merchants can sell physical product over steem blockchain in SBDs or in Steem. This way people won't even have to buy or sell steem for Fiat for their living. Steem will eventually become the base currency. (of all communities, or even possibly in the real world!)
