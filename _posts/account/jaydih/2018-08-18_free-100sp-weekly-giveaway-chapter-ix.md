><sub>"Oh! I almost missed of participating this week.
I'm doing my best to keep newbies in our community #cameroon by supporting and encouraging them with upvotes and comments. We are over 30 (which you can check here) but most have given up because of lack of support. I see Steemit to be more fun and addictive when one is able to fit in to a community. I would to encourage the few that are remaining and I believe others will start getting in again. Thank you!"
