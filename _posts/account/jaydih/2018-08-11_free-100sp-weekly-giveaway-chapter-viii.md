><sub>"Did u wake up already? Lol
Let me quickly type in my entry, well here goes ‚Äî My sister actually told me to join here and telling me ‚Äòit‚Äôs worth a try‚Äô so I am taking the chance right now.
What‚Äôs really my purpose here on steemit? To be honest I don‚Äôt know. I have no idea! Then all day yesterday, I was asking myself, what‚Äôs really my purpose? I mean I post whatever I think of that day, it maybe about my kids, cooking, adventures, crafts etc. but why did I even started blogging here in steemit im not even a blogger. My grammars isn‚Äôt that good, but you know what it fulfilled me. I‚Äôm a stay at home mom, my job is to take care of the kids and the household, I‚Äôm not complaining I‚Äôm actually lucky to have a good husband who is a good provider. But having to express yourself sometimes is a good feeling, and hoping I influence some moms out there just like me that life as moms isn‚Äôt just suppose to be cleaning all day and taking care of kids. You can do greater things just belive in yourself!
Hmmm i think I‚Äôve said what I really wanted to say. Lol thank you just by reading this I‚Äôm already a true winner. üëçüèª"

`You are, indeed, the true winner! Way to go mom! I don't expect anyone must have a purpose when it comes to post things on steemit. Just sharing daily life, bunch of talking, or sharing nice photos or stories maybe more than enough as long as you are enjoying it here in the free open space of blockchain. Now, go enjoy more with extra 100 sp.`

Believe me it's always hard for me to pick one person out of many applicants, but I do want to keep my [purpose](https://steemit.com/steemit/@jaydih/free-steem-power-delegation-relay-100sp-for-4-weeks-long) straight. "One person every week, continuously."
<sub>`Please don't forget to apply again and again until it gets your turn!! I mean serious.`</sub>

Now, let's expect @twodorks to bring more positive energy to Steemit! **Also, for those of you who want to become the next week's winner please leave a comment below.**

AND, Thank you to those who are willing support or already supporting this giveaway project!
