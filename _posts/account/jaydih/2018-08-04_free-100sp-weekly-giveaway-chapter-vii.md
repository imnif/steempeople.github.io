><sub>"Wow! This is the first time to encounter this kind of giveaway.. ill give it a try.
Uhmmm.. 100 SP will go long way for sure. But why me? Hmmmm tough one. There is only thing i want in this flatform, i want to be heard, the voice of parents out there. I mean all post seems to trend on how to get rich here on steemit. So, Id like to promote the greatness in motherhood, the journey maybe tough but you will get through once you get to know you are not alone. So in my own little way, my posts are all about my family. My two super hyper active kids. And my not so boring everyday life. I make it a point to post 1 ot 2 everyday so not to lose contact in the community.
How was that? Haha did i pass?"
