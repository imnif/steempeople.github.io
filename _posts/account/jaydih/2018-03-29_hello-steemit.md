Hello folks!

I finally get to post my very first posting on steemit!

*(I feel very awkward and a bit even shy to be honest as I have never participated in such things before... and yet my first ever posting get to be stored permanently.. forever.. yeah.. that's encouraging* &#128584; &#128514;*)*

Personally, when I first found out about decentralized, blockchain based, "transaction fee-less", and writers/readers rewarded blogging/media platform, which is steemit, I was just mind blown. I wish I could have found out earlier! But I still think this is a very early stage with great potential waiting ahead of us.

So,.. now let me introduce "a part of myself" because I feel like I should post the only thing which will never ever change in my life time as this posting will be stored permanently..! 

I am a crazy dog lover, literally I just love dogs so much. I can promise that permanently.
I am a very.. very! passionate person. I have been, I want to be, and I will be, permanently.
I am a South Korean. I have been, and I will be. For sure, this an irreversible birthmark my parents gave me long before the blockchain technology. &#128077;

안녕하세요 스팀잇 여러분~! 반갑습니다! 앞으로 잘 부탁 드립니다.

Well, that's about me. Quite short, huh? Other than this, I am very vulnerable and subjected to change every minute. If I state anything further I might even get accused of being a lier in the near future. Who knows. &#128540;

Thanks guys for reading all the way up here. I'm looking forward to seeing a brighter future every day for everyone through blockchain technology for every precious day goes by.

See you around Steemians!

Oh, before I wrap up, here's a picture of my beloved dog, Binu.
It's a samoyed. Yes, the smiley dog; she came all the way from Italy to Korea.
